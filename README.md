# Image-Compression-with-Haar-DWT
Description: This program compresses an image by using the 2D Discrete Wavelet Transform (with Haar wavelets).

Demonstration: For a demo, execute the python file 'run.py'
- Libraries: NumPy, PIL, Matplotlib
- Run time ~ 2 sec
- Compression: You may vary the scale (of compression) on line 311. Default is 1
- Input: You may specify the path to any image in line 309. The default is 'img.jpg'
  - Note: This program works on *grayscale* images whose dimensions are powers of 2. The input image will be converted & cropped to enforce these requirements.
